#+TITLE: ChilIR, Chil Intermediate Representation

ChilIR, Chil Intermediate Representation, (pronounced chiller) is an s-expression-based IR for elaborated hardware.
ChilIR is intended to behave similarly to [[https://github.com/chipsalliance/firrtl][FIRRTL]].

ChilIR is intended to be integrated with Chil and its simulator.

* Why ChilIR?
Alternatives exist: FIRRTL & CIRCT.
Why create another alternative?

Chil is built on top of Lisp, which makes parsing s-expressions trivial compared to the other formats.
Using s-expressions would simplify the simulator's internals, because Lisp already expects everything as s-expressions.
